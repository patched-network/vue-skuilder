`skuilder` (**Sk**ill B**uilder**) seeks to build on the legacy of great open-source personalized learning software (hi, [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/?download)).

# Major Goals

**Friendlier end-user experiences** by default. Anki was and is a power tool that makes stiff demands on its users. Under this category we're interested in:
- replacing card count configuration with time commitment configuration,
-

**More interactive experiences** in context of individual cards.

# Overview




# Roadmap




# Caveats

This documentation is both *in-progess* and also not really intended to be *fully comprehensive*.

At present, the project's modular components require a little cajoling to work together in different contexts (eg, static-site vs live backend, standalone course vs course development platform).

This site focuses on **standalone** courses built for **static deployment** and browser-local user data.
