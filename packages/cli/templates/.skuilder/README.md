# .skuilder Directory

**⚠️ WARNING: GENERATED CONTENT - DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY ⚠️**

This directory contains files generated by the Skuilder CLI tools and is **NOT** intended for manual editing except under experimental circumstances.

## Contents

- `studio-builds/` - Cached builds of studio-ui with local question types
  - Each subdirectory represents a different build based on your `src/questions/` content
  - Builds are automatically managed by `skuilder studio` command
  - Safe to delete - will be regenerated as needed

## Purpose

The Skuilder CLI uses this directory to cache studio-ui builds that include your local question types. This enables:

- Fast startup of `skuilder studio` when your questions haven't changed
- Isolation between different question type configurations
- Automatic rebuild when your local questions are modified

## Maintenance

- **Safe to delete**: The entire `.skuilder` directory can be deleted safely
- **Automatic cleanup**: Old builds may be cleaned up automatically
- **Version control**: This directory should be ignored by git (check your .gitignore)
