# Assessment of `nextCard()` Performance

The `nextCard()` function in `SessionController.ts` is experiencing performance issues, with execution times ranging from acceptable to several seconds. The root cause of this inconsistency appears to be in the data retrieval logic, specifically within the `ELONavigator` class, which is responsible for fetching new and review cards for a study session.

## The Problem: N+1 Queries

The primary performance bottleneck is a classic "N+1 query" problem in the `ELONavigator.getPendingReviews()` method. This method makes two separate, sequential database calls:

1.  **`this.user.getPendingReviews(this.course.getCourseID())`**: Fetches a list of all pending review cards for the user.
2.  **`this.course.getCardEloData(reviews.map((r) => r.cardId))`**: For each card returned in the first query, this method makes an additional query to retrieve the card's ELO data.

This means that if a user has 20 pending reviews, the `getPendingReviews()` method will make 21 database queries (1 to get the reviews, and 20 to get the ELO data for each review). This is highly inefficient and is the most likely cause of the long and unpredictable delays.

A similar, though likely less severe, issue exists in the `getNewCards()` method, which also makes multiple database calls.

## The Solution: Server-Side Data Aggregation

The most effective way to resolve this issue is to move the data aggregation logic to the server-side (i.e., into a CouchDB view or a server-side function). Instead of making multiple round trips to the database, we can create a single query that joins the review and ELO data and returns it in a single response.

This will require the following changes:

1.  **Create a new CouchDB view:** This view will be responsible for joining the user's pending reviews with the corresponding card ELO data.
2.  **Modify `ELONavigator.getPendingReviews()`:** This method will be updated to query the new CouchDB view instead of making two separate database calls.
3.  **(Optional but Recommended)** **Refactor `ELONavigator.getNewCards()`:** This method should also be refactored to reduce the number of database calls.

## Recommendation

I recommend that we proceed with the server-side data aggregation approach. This will significantly improve the performance and reliability of the `nextCard()` function and provide a better user experience.

I will now create a plan to implement these changes.
