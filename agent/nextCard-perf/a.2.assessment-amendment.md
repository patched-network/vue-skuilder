# Assessment Amendment: `nextCard()` Performance

This document amends the initial assessment in `a.1.assessment.md`.

## Refined Problem Analysis

My initial analysis correctly identified that multiple database round-trips were the source of the performance issue. However, I incorrectly pinpointed *when* these trips occurred.

The user correctly pointed out that the latency does not happen during the initial `prepareSession()` call, but rather *after* each `nextCard()` call. Here's the corrected flow:

1.  `prepareSession()` populates the internal queues (`reviewQ`, `newQ`) with `StudySessionItem` objects. These objects are lightweight and only contain IDs and metadata, not the full card content. This initial population is relatively fast.
2.  The UI calls `nextCard()`, which dequeues a single `StudySessionItem`. This is a fast, in-memory operation.
3.  The UI receives the `StudySessionItem` and now has a `cardID`. To render the card, the UI must then make **two separate, sequential network requests** to CouchDB:
    1.  Fetch the main card document.
    2.  Fetch the card's associated data document, which is pointed to by the main card document.
4.  These two on-demand fetches for every single card are the direct cause of the interactive lag the user experiences.

## Revised Recommendation

The user's proposal to maintain a client-side buffer of fully "hydrated" cards is the correct approach. This strategy involves pre-fetching the next few cards in the background so they are immediately available in memory when `nextCard()` is called. This moves the latency from an interactive "blocking" operation to a non-blocking background task.

I agree with this approach and will create a new plan based on it.
