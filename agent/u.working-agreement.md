This folder is the working scratchpad for user+assistant development.

# Conventions

files prefixed with `u.` are user-authored.
files prefixed with `a.` are assistant-authored.

assistant-authored files should be sequenced, so that the progression of thoughts (and plan revisions) remains legible. - eg, create `a.1.assessment.md` `a.2.plan.md` `a.3.todo.md`, or whatever working documents are required.

When performing actions, planning or instructions from *later* documents take precidence over earlier ones.

Other files in the directory are sourced as general context or informtion relevant to the current mission.

The user will annotate / edit assistant files in order to specifically direct feedback to the assistant's work.

Where there are numbered directories in this folder, these correspond to github issues. Feel free also to use `gh` to reference the issue itself if need be.

# General Expected Workflow

We are a document-centric team, you and I.

Turn 0 (user):
- user will include a file like `issue.md`, `failure.log`, or something different.
- user will supply it to an assistant, along with supporting context in the prompt if necessary.

Turn 1 (assistant):
- assistant will read the file, *look around*, and write `a.assessment.md`

a.assessment.md should detail the some options, and end with a `# Recommendation` section.

Turn 2 (user):
- User will read assessment and either:
 - provide more context as necessary,
 - ask follow-up questions, or
 - select a promising option from the assessment

If the user provides or asks for more info, assistant will discuss and together they will refine the assessment.


If the user makes a selection:

turn 3 (assistant):
- assistant will create `a.plan.md` and `a.todo.md`. The first outlines the plan, the second itemizes and chunks it into phases.


At this point we are into the main loop of the session.

{{
Main Loop:

- User will assign chunks of tasks from the todo list to the assistant
- Agent will attempt to complete the tasks.
 - if successful, assistant will write and `a.next.md` with a suggested next chunk
 - if unsucessful, we break the flow and debug / rethink together



- User will review the assistant changes, and:
 - if satisfied, indicate so and either:
   - ask the assistant to carry on with their `a.next.md` suggestion
   - redirect to a different set of tasks
 - if unsatisfied, main loop breaks and we debug / rethink together


Where a user approves the changes, before moving on, the assistant will update the `a.todo.md` file to reflect completed and potentiall *in flight* tasks.

At the end of each agentic turn, assistant can rewrite `a.next.md` from scratch.

# General Notes

## Task Focus

When performing tasks, the assistant should attempt to be narrowly focused on the specific designated task or task chunk.

If, in the process of a task, the assistant discovers tangential issues, issues unrelated to the current task, or similar, the assistant should create a **new working document** for the discovered issue. The created working document should have a title roughly in the format of `a.aside.<category>.<title>.md`.

eg: `a.aside.perf.many-round-trips-in-reviews-lookup.md`, `a.aside.security.addCourse-endpoint-not-authenticated.md`, etc.

The agent should expect the user to review these asides async to the current main workflow.

# Coda

This document and flow are experimental. If, experientially, it feels like it is not working, we can change it. Open to suggestions!

Thank you!
